## Architecture

AniData VPN is built on a modular architecture that consists of several key components:

### Core Components

- **Network Module**: Manages network connections, routing, and traffic handling
- **Protocol Module**: Implements various VPN protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2, etc.)
- **Security Module**: Handles encryption, authentication, and security features
- **AI Module**: Provides intelligent routing and threat detection

### Infrastructure

The global server infrastructure is distributed across 100+ countries with redundancy and load balancing to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

For more details, see [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md).

## Protocols

AniData supports multiple VPN protocols to provide flexibility and optimal performance across different network environments:

- **WireGuard**: Modern, fast, and secure protocol with minimal overhead
- **OpenVPN**: Mature, widely supported protocol with strong security features
- **IKEv2/IPSec**: Excellent for mobile connections with strong security and stability
- **Stealth Mode**: Special protocol for bypassing deep packet inspection in restricted networks

For protocol configuration and comparison, see [Protocol Documentation](protocols/index.md).

## Security Features

AniData implements advanced security features to ensure complete privacy and protection:

- **Military-grade Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all data
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ensures past sessions cannot be compromised
- **Multi-hop Routing**: Routes traffic through multiple servers for enhanced anonymity
- **Kill Switch**: Prevents data leaks by blocking all traffic if the VPN connection drops
- **DNS Leak Protection**: Ensures DNS requests are always routed through the VPN
- **WebRTC Leak Prevention**: Blocks WebRTC leaks that could expose your IP address

For more security details, see [Security Documentation](security/index.md).
